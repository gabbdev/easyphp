## Documentation
[In the documentation](https://easyphp.gitbook.io/easyphp/) you can see the existing functions and how to install in detail.
##  About

EasyPHP is a Node.js module PHP preprocessor in a practical and easy way.

- ‚úÖ Guaranteed performance
- üîß Easy to use
- üìö Integrated PHP library
- üèì Absurdly low latency

## Why???
To be honest, a php server is a **lot** of work. and worse, some servers do not support some things from native php, which can cause a lot of mess and trouble. Easyphp **solves** this for you, the only thing you need to have installed is node.js, in addition, you can already start your php server in **less than 2** minutes!

##  Installation

  

**Node.js 12.0.0 or newer is required.**

Ignore any warnings about unmet peer dependencies, as they're all optional.

  

```gml
npm install easyphp
```

  

##  Example Usage

```js
var  php  =  require('easyphp');

php.start(9090,  function()  {
console.log('Started successfully!');
})

php.get('/home',  'home.php',  function(err)  {
console.log('The home has been accessed!');
}); 

php.get('/home/about',  'about.php',  function(err)  {
console.log('The "about" has been accessed!');
});
php.all() // Loads all folders and subfolders.
```

  

##  Help

**Do I need to download php or another external program?**
- No! It is not necessary to install anything other than the module. everything is integrated so there is no need.

**Are ALL php functions present?**
- No, the most important functions are present, but small functions are yet to come.

**Which devices support easyphp?**
- all with the requirements of node.js v12 or higher.
